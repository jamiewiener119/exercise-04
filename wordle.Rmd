### Step 1
```{r}
load_dictionary <- function(filename){ #Creating function with single argument, "filename"
  library(readr) #Loading {readr} so I can read in .txt from https:// filename
   f <- filename #f should be https:// filename
   d <- read_tsv(f, col_names = TRUE) #Creating dataframe from .txt file
   return(d$words) #Creating vector from "words" column (column name of single column in both .txt files)
}

valid_list <- load_dictionary("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamiewiener119/exercise-04/main/collins-scrabble-words-2019.txt") #Creating vector, valid_list, of valid words to guess
solution_list <- load_dictionary("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamiewiener119/exercise-04/main/google-10000-english-usa-no-swears.txt") #Creating vector, solution_list, of possible solution words

str(valid_list) #Checking if above was successful
str(solution_list)
```
